What did you like about this project?
It's fun to try to figure out the steps involved in building out the game.

What did you struggle with in this project?
I'm still not quite up to speed with Javascript Objects and Classes :( 
Only managed to finish 50% of the LearnJavascript path in Codecademy as I was fighting unforeseen fires at my 'day' job since Friday (my admin staff resigned *cry*). 
Finished teaching and work only around 11pm and didn't have the mental energy to code from scratch :(
So am feeling pretty lost.

Learnt that the assignment is actually from Codecademy so I heavily referenced the solution.
I feel like I cheated, so sorry Jean :(
But I tried to figure out the steps in the solution and put down comments.
There're still some parts I'm unsure about and I'll try to catch up with the Javascript path the next few days.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Jean has already been very merciful to extend the deadline, plus she helped us get set up with the field code. So I think it's on me to catch up on the learning!
